# Simple Math

# We're going to work with print statements to output the results to the screen.

# You can separate multiple print items with a comma, as shown below:

print("Four times four is ", 4 * 4)

# Addition
print("5 + 3 is ", 5 + 3)

# Subtraction
print("6 - 2 is ", 6 - 2)

# Multiplication
print("10 * 20 is ", 10 * 20)

# Division
print("55 // 2 is ", 55 // 2) 

# Precise Division (using floats)
print("55.0 / 2 is ", 55.0 / 2)
print("55 / 2.0 is ", 55 / 2.0)
print("55.0 / 2.0 is ", 55.0 / 2.0)

# Remainder Division
print("55 % 2 is ", 55 % 2) # This is super useful for determining whether a number is odd or even

# Powers
print("2 ** 10 is ", 2 ** 10)
